    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>The guiso de arroz is a recipe that is passed down familiarly.</p>

    <p>Although there is a basic recipe, it is fun to add other vegetables or herbs and spices; 
    gently modifying the typical flavors of yellow rice.</p>
        
    <p>We can say that the preparation time is ten minutes and that it takes forty minutes to cook.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
    180 grams of rice. 200 grams of chicken breast.
    1 large onion.
    1 clove garlic.
    1 red bell pepper.
    1 green bell pepper.
    30 ml of concentrated tomato or 1 peeled tomato.
    120 ml of white wine.
    750 ml of chicken broth.
    Saffron in threads.
    50 grams of Chickpeas.
    Salt and pepper.</ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <p>For a better organization, it is advisable 
    to prepare all the ingredients before starting the kitchen task.

    <p>Wash the vegetables.</p>
        
    <p>Chop the onion and garlic finely. Reserve.</p>
        
    <p>Remove the seeds from the bell peppers and cut them into small squares. Reserve.</p>
        
    <p>Dry the breast with kitchen paper. Cut into medium cubes - approximately one bite. Reserve.</p>
        
    <p>Heat the broth and keep it warm.</p>

    <p>Heat a saucepan and place a bottom of olive oil. 
    Fry the onion with a pinch of salt. Hold the fire strong.</p>

    <p>Add the garlic and cook for two minutes, stir so it does not burn.</p>

    <p>Add the bell peppers and cook for between six and eight minutes, 
    over moderate heat to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pot.</p>

    <p>Add the chicken. Mix carefully to integrate the ingredients. Season with salt and pepper lightly.</p>

    <p>Saut√© the preparation over a higher heat so that the cooking is even and has a good color.</p>

    <p>Add the blended or pureed tomato. Cook three more minutes.</p>

    <p>Add the wine. Mix well. Lower the heat level and continue cooking so that the wine evaporates.</p>

    <p>Add the rice and cook for two or three minutes all together, stirring well.</p>

    <p>Cover with the broth and add the saffron, a dash of lemon juice and thyme to taste.</p>

    <p>Maintain the minimum heat and continue cooking slowly, another ten or fifteen minutes.</p>

    <p>Constantly monitor the level of the broth to prevent it from drying out excessively. 
    Stir gently from time to time. At the end, add the chickpeas.</p>

    <p>When the rice is almost ready, remove from the heat. 
    Let stand for five minutes with the saucepan covered.</p>

    <p>Take to the table and enjoy the aroma and special flavor of the yellow rice stew.</p>
